# Horiseon-SEO

## What is the purpose?

*Horiseon-SEO* is a code refactor, and my first time to use HTML and CSS on a published project. My goal was to create alt tags for images, correctly use semantic html elements, and make improvements on the code.

Starting with a working code helped me to understand how a code can be improved by changing HTML elements while still leaving the functional website. I also have learned about some accessibility features, and why integrating them is essential to good web design. In addition, this project helped me become familiar with git and Github.
